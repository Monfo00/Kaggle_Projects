# Kaggle Projects
In this directory, I showcase several projects I worked during my university studies, utilizing datasets sourced from Kaggle.

## **Taxi tips amount**
The dataset of the competition is taken from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Each observation corresponds to a ride taken in a yellow taxi cab; while data exists for billions of rides across several years, we will look at a subset of data from May 2015. The response of interest is the tip amount, the amount tipped to the driver. The data has been filtered to contain only those transactions paid for with a credit card.

## **Star classification**
The data consists of 100,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.
